# Project Title
Prediction of used-car quality using machine learning (in R).

The current project aims to perform the prediction of used cars quality by using machine learning. As this field of research has only starting to gain attention, the reluctance of most car vendors to reveal their research findings may have indirectly contributed to the lack of literature on this regard. However, the rapid expansion of the used car industry may lead to an influx of number of used cars to be evaluated by the used car dealers. Consequently, the increased number of vehicles in varying conditions and types may overwhelm the dealersâ€™ ability to correctly discern the vehicle quality. Machine learning has been proposed as a viable solution as the judgment of the vehicle quality can be automated by analysing the vehicle attributes. The findings of the current project revealed that machine learning may be the suitable solution to predict vehicle quality. Particularly, most models were able to detect large portion of the bad buy (vehicle that suffer from irreparable damage).
